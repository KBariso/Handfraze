                             <p>ASL is used by Deaf and Hard of Hearing Americans in all places of business and education. ASL is America's most modern naturally-born language, yet is not always recognized as an official language.</p>
                             <p>ASL helps us be inclusive but is also a helpful tool to communicate in loud places, at long distances, or privately. Above all, learning ASL makes for a more equitable world.</p>
